The resulting table contained the arrondissements number, longitude, latitude, venue, venue longitude longitude and latitude and venue category. Since each arrondissement's area is varried between 0.3 square miles to 3.3 square miles, there may be duplicates in our search result. We therefore dropped duplicate venues that appeared in our search.\n",
